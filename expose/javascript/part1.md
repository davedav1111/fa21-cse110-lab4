3. 
```
values added: 20
```
4. Nothing is printed by line 13. The code outputs an error at line 13. This is because the variable ```result``` is declared using ```let```, so it is only accessible within the if-statement code block. Since line 13 is outside of the if-statement, it will produce an error when we try to access ```result``` there. 
5. Nothing is printed by line 9. The code outputs an error at line 7 because it attempts to reassign a value to the ```const``` variable ```result```. 
6. Similar to question 5, nothing is printed by line 13 since the code outputs an error before line 13.
